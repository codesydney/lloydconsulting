# Lloyd Consulting

## About the Project
This is a new website for Lloyd Criminal Consulting Co. 

Having identified a gap in the employment market for the on-boarding and management of people with a criminal record in organisations, Lloyd Criminal Consulting Co works in the space between employers and ex-prisoners and provides best-practice support, education, and training on how to engage and work with people impacted by the Criminal Justice System, and other marginalised populations.
